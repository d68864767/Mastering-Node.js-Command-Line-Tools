# Mastering Node.js Command Line Tools

This project is about mastering Node.js command line tools using OpenAI API. It demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to perform tasks and how to handle environment variables in Node.js.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mastering-nodejs-command-line-tools.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd mastering-nodejs-command-line-tools
```

3. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key
```bash
echo OPENAI_API_KEY=yourapikey > .env
```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Node.js application on your local machine.
